# Query Chatbot 

<img src="/assets/mascot.jpeg" width=30% height=30%>

This is my attempt in building a query chatbot over one's own documents. Or simply think of it as a search engine that gives you
relevant and coherent results, rather than an exact match over words found in the document. 

This chatbot has been trained on publicly available web pages on the [National Climate Change Secretariat Singapore (NCCS](https://nccs.gov.sg)) site. In future, I hope to extend the database to more governmental websites so that this is a MVP on how to interact with governmental resources through a centralised interface. h.
